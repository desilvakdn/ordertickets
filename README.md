# Evenly Distribute Tickets

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Place your source file** `lottery_tickets.csv` inside the `data` directory.

3. **Compile the Java program** using the terminal or your IDE. In the terminal, run:

   ```bash
   javac Program.java
   ```

4. **Run the program** from the terminal:

   ```bash
   java Program
   ```

   The program will read from the `data/lottery_tickets.csv` file, process it, and generate an ordered list of tickets saved to `data/ordered_lottery_tickets.csv`.

## Output

The output CSV file `ordered_lottery_tickets.csv` will be saved inside the `data` directory once the program has finished running.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that the `data/lottery_tickets.csv` file exists and is properly formatted.
- Make sure Java is installed and correctly set up in your environment.
